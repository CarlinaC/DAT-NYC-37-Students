    "This project attempts to take a look at U.S. primary election data to discern trends that will assist in predicting general election outcome. With this election cycle, there appears to be greater polarization between the two major political parties. Due to this variation in political options, we believe it will be easier to predict the general election outcome based on primary results. We predict that by discerning the underlying voter characteristics (age, ethnicity, education level, etc.) in key swing states, we can determine the preferences of the 'so-called' median voter that the general election will hinge on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are predicting voter preference, we are modeling a machine learning problem that is predicting a binary target of a form resembling the following: {0: Democrat vote, 1: Republican vote}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Predicting this outcome will ultimately help me sleep better at night as the current political and social events occurring across the globe are disconcerting. There is also a wealth of research and work that shows election years having some large impact on the economy. Given the disparate views between each candidate, knowing with some level of confidence the outcome of the election can help lead one to making investment decisions that would be favored by the incoming POTUS.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is my belief that race and region will play the largest role in determining the outcome of the upcoming presidential election"

In simplest form, it posits that an election between two candidates will be ultimately decided by the preference of the median voter. Given the two-party political system exhibited in the United States, I believe the general election will follow a similar form (as it has in elections past), since the presidency will be won center of the extremes of each political platform.\n",

If we are able to obtain datasets with this information, we may attempt to capture this data as well.\n",
