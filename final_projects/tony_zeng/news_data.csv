Sign up for the e-mail here.</br></br>On Friday evening, with Congress out of town on its summer recess and Americans heading into a mid-August weekend, the Bush administration sent a message to the states: The federal government will make it tougher for a national children's insurance program to cover the offspring of middle-income families.</br></br>The State Children's Health Insurance Program was created in 1997 to help children whose families couldn't afford insurance but didn't qualify for Medicaid, and administration officials tell the New York Times that the changes are aimed at returning the program to its low- income focus and assuring it didn't become a replacement for private insurance. Administration point man Dennis Smith wrote to state officials saying there would be new restrictions on the District of Columbia and the 18 states -- including California and New York -- that extend or plan to extend coverage for children whose families make more than 250% of Federal poverty levels. For a family of three that 250% is $42,900, and for a family of four it's $51,625. Under the new limits, a child from a family making more would have to spend one year uninsured before qualifying, and any state that wants to extend coverage would have to assure Washington that at least 95% of children eligible for SCHIP or Medicaid are enrolled in one of the programs. But as the Associated Press reports, no state can currently make such assurances.</br></br>Rachel Klein, deputy director of health policy for advocacy group Families USA, tells the AP that since many families above the 250% threshold can't afford private insurance, ""the effect of this policy is to have more uninsured kids."" Ann Clemency Kohler, deputy commissioner of human services in New Jersey, tells the Times the changes ""will cause havoc with our program and could jeopardize coverage for thousands of children."" States have already been imposing waiting periods and taking other steps to prevent parents from moving their children from private insurance to SCHIP, which currently serves some 6.6 million children, the Washington Post notes. The administration's new restrictions come as the program, which expires at the end of next month if Congress doesn't reauthorize it, is the subject of a larger political fight that pits the White House against Democrats and some Republicans in Congress and state capitals."

Management is under pressure to reduce productivity losses, turnover, insurance costs and the risk of lawsuits for personal and property damage caused by drug-impaired workers. Management also is under sales pressure from a growing cadre of laboratories, test-kit manufacturers and consultants who extol the virtues of testing. A common argument is the following: ""Your competitors are starting to require drug tests. If you don't, their work force will be clean and you will end up with all the junkies.""</br></br>Many companies that have implemented widespread drug-testing programs, however, have learned that there is a downside to testing. They have experienced the protests of employees and civil libertarians and have watched the proliferation of lawsuits alleging invasion of privacy, defamation and other legal theories. A Texas railroad employee was awarded $200,000 in damages when his employer misreported the results of a drug test. Numerous other cases are pending.</br></br>Is there a middle ground? Can safety and efficiency be protected without invading the privacy of applicants and employees?</br></br>A growing number of companies have concluded that drug testing should be the least important part of a comprehensive drug-abuse program. The starting point is a drug-awareness program to educate managers, supervisors and employees about the dangers and signs of drug abuse. The second part of the program is an effective employee-assistance program (EAP). Rehabilitation is preferable to punishment or dismissal (at least for initial or nonserious offenses) because it encourages employees to seek help voluntarily, improves labor relations and is cost-effective by restoring valuable employees to productive status. More than one company that heedlessly adopted a ""screen and fire"" policy on drugs had second thoughts after discovering traces of drugs in some of their most productive employees.</br></br>There may be a place for drug testing in a company's drug-abuse program, but there are limits to the effectiveness of testing. To begin with, the accuracy of some drug tests varies widely, and the test results are often unacceptable even when performed by professional laboratories. Last year the Centers for Disease Control published the results of a 10-year study of laboratory testing for amphetamines, barbiturates, cocaine, codeine, methadone and morphine. Virtually all of the laboratories in the study had unacceptably high error rates."

As early as July 1984, for example, then Secretary of Health and Human Services Margaret Heckler proclaimed that the Reagan administration had ""broken {its} back."" This assessment seems to be widely shared within the business community. And this July, headlines announced that ""spending on health care in 1985 rose at the lowest level in two decades."" Unfortunately, rumors about the defeat of the ""health-care monster"" may be vastly exaggerated.</br></br>How did the health-care cost spiral start? During the 1960s and 1970s the American people implicitly signed a social contract with the nation's providers of health services that was so open-ended as to be almost incredible. Under this contract, the providers would be left alone to determine how best to treat the illnesses of their patients. As compensation they were issued keys to sundry health-insurance treasuries, there to recoup whatever auditable costs they had incurred (if they were hospitals) or to fetch whatever fees they deemed ""usual, customary and reasonable"" (if they were physicians). Only very mild and generally ineffective limits were ever placed on the sums taken by individual physicians or hospitals from these insurance treasuries. Not surprisingly, prices varied widely and often capriciously among providers, and overall outlays on health care climbed.</br></br>This benificent contract was written at a time when most experts thought the nation was short of both doctors and hospital beds, so that health-care providers largely dictated the terms of the contract. Inevitably, however, the very generosity of the deal drew into the medical profession legions of educated baby-boomers eager to do well by doing good. By the late 1970s, an erstwhile sellers' market had thus transformed itself into a buyers' market with surplus capacity all around.</br></br>More than two-thirds of all health services or products are paid at point of service, not by the patient, but by some third party -- either a private insurance carrier or the public sector. As early as the late 1970s, these third-party payers began attempting to control escalating health-care costs. After Ronald Reagan's election in 1980, a two-pronged attack was made upon the health-cost monster.</br></br>The first came from the business community, which pays for about a third of all health-care expenditures through employer-paid health-insurance premiums. It sought to control the rise in its premiums by forcing employees to share a greater proportion of their health-care bills at point of consumption, and by encouraging them to join so-called Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) or Health Maintenance Organizations (HMOs). Under a PPO a business firm (and/or its insurance carrier) seeks price concessions from a limited set of doctors and hospitals who render care on a fee-for-service basis. In return for these price concessions, the firm offers its employees financial inducements to seek health care only from providers within the PPO network. Under the HMO contract, a network of physicians and hospitals contracts to provide a firm's employees all necessary health care in return for a flat, prepaid annual fee. The HMO thus has every incentive to minimize the costs of treating patients."

But it is at the markets, brimming with traditionally designed wool sweaters, bags, hammocks and wall hangings -- all crafted on imported looms -- that the Otavaleno's much-touted entrepreneurial savvy is on display. Behind the walls of many humble homes in this town, substantial inventories of those same products are bound for markets in Colombia, Chile, Venezuela, Europe and the U.S.</br></br>Located two hours north of Quito by car, on a winding and rutty road, this is said to be the only indigenous community -- of about 40 -- in the country never to have been brought under the control of the Spanish conquistadors. Ergo, instead of the stereotypical Indian poverty and isolation, the dignified Otavaleno is renowned for his independence and worldliness.</br></br>There is one thing, however, that Otavalenos share with this country's other Indian groups, mestizos and Europeans: profound economic suffering at the hands of the perniciously politicized Ecuadoran central bank. Since August 1998 the country's currency, known as the sucre, has lost 80% of its value in dollar terms, destroying savings and living standards; 1999 gross domestic product contracted 26.6% in dollar terms. Inflation, which in 1999 was more than 60%, is forecast to reach 90% in 2000.</br></br>Things are so bad here that even Ecuador's politicians, notorious fans of the central bank as an inexhaustible source of generosity, have caught on. This explains how it is that on Tuesday the Ecuadoran Congress narrowly passed a law mandating that within 180 days the central bank's dollar reserves will be used to retire the paper sucres currently in circulation -- at a rate of 25,000 to one. The new law marks the end of the central bank's power to print money and the beginning of economic hope for 12 million Ecuadorans.</br></br>Yet, it is still only hope. The law grossly perverts the term dollarization in order to preserve specific discretionary central-bank powers such as setting reserve requirements and interest rates and the ability to intervene in the markets through the use of repurchase agreements. The central bankers, it would seem, harbor a deep-seated desire to manipulate monetary outcomes even in the absence of a domestic currency system. This is absurd, but it is also illustrative in that it dramatically defines the core problems of the country: The central bankers, along with this country's other privileged elite, are dug in so hard that nonsense becomes law at their behest.
