    "Answer: The data shows, as expected, that higher GPA and GRE scores do correspond with higher graduate school admission rates. The prestige of a student's alma mater does seem to help iff the school has a prestige of 1. All other prestige values seem to yield higher denial rates than admissions. GPA seems to have the biggest impact and that makes sense since it is a more long term description of a student than GRE (which is a measure of performance on a single exam.) While alma mater prestige might not make too much of a difference for better schools, attending a lower prestige university can greatly impact a student's chances of being admitted into grad school. \n",
    "\n",
    "I could potentially improve my results by using a different cross validation method (like K-fold) or using different predictors. There are also a few additional pieces of data that I believe would be valuable in conducting a larger study.\n",
    "1. Student's major (both at alma mater and for applied grad program): Student profiles of artistic majors are very different from those applying for medical school. \n",
    "2. Relative prestige: Similar to the above, just because a university has a great English department does not mean its Biology department is also top notch. While schools are getting more and more selective, it seems that individual programs at universities often carry more weight than the university itself for graduate admissions.\n",
    "3. Personal connection to applied school: Students with family, friends, or faculty who are alumnus of a particular institution can help a student get in with a recommendation letter. It would be helpful to measure these students against students who get in on their own merits alone and compare the differences.\n",
    "4. Race / Ethnicity / Sex: While we like to believe all schools are equal opportunity, universities do seek out particular diversity percentages in each accepted class. "
