    "# Project Design Writeup and Approval Template\n",
    "\n",

    "### Project Problem and Hypothesis\n",
    "* What's the project about? What problem are you solving?\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is about predicting whether a news article has a positive or negative indication of the US economy.\n",
    "* Where does this seem to reside as a machine learning problem? Are you predicting some continuous number, or predicting a binary value?\n",
    "\n",
    "This project will revolve around reading certain keywords from the news article title and summary to predict the impact it have on the US economy. This will be a continuous number: 1-9 (9 - positive, 1 - negative)\n",
    "* What kind of impact do you think it could have?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think readers will have a better understanding of the US economy and what type of events impact the economy positively and negatively. \n",
    "* What do you think will have the most impact in predicting the value you are interested in solving for?\n",
    "\n",
    "I think the ranking of the news article from a scale of 0-9 and the keywords are associated with each ranking. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets\n",
    "* Description of data set available, at the field level (see table)\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set have 5000 rows with article headline and a short, bolded excerpt of a sentence or two from the artcile. The dataset also provide whether the sentence provide a indication of the US economy's health, then rated the indication on a scale 1-9. with 1 being being negative and 9 being positive.\n",
